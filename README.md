## Problem

* Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.

* Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder.
## Example Pseudo-code
```bash
groupArrayElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3);
// [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ]
```
## Development

### Setup

* In a terminal/command line navigate to the project directory.

The tests are located in src/App.test.js file

### To run locally:

* In a terminal/command line navigate to the project directory.
